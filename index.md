## What are the modpacks features?

### Simple!

Featuring a high quality, challenging and balanced, immersive survival experience with a lot of exploration and lots of dungeons to conquer.

This pack has over 100 hours of challenging gameplay and balanced progression without ever getting boring.

Made with focus on singleplayer and multiplayer playability and low lag, our own servers run at least 15-20 players without any lag.



- Conquer dungeons and find loot in chests and mineshafts
- Find many different trinkets, baubles and rare upgrade-able jewelry
- Curse enchantments play a big role in gearing, they have a chance to appear upon enchanting, so you often wear suboptimal pieces or work around negative effects
- Obtaining optimal gear is a more difficult and a long-term process
